## Overview

![screenshot](preview.png)

The project is hosted on Vercel. It took about a couple of hours to complete. I needed to refresh my knowledge on grid since I have issues with it as well as media queries. I am so used to frameworks that I forget the fundamental information required for responsive web desgin.

### Built With
